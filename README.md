# AI Learning Journey 🚀

This repository documents my structured journey into **Artificial Intelligence**, covering:
**Python → Machine Learning → Deep Learning → Generative AI**.

I am pursuing this alongside my internship, focusing on **strong fundamentals, hands-on coding, and real projects** rather than rushed learning.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a solid foundation in Python and AI concepts  
- Learn by **coding and problem-solving**, not just watching tutorials  
- Create meaningful projects that reflect real-world use cases  
- Gradually become **industry-ready for AI/ML/GenAI roles**

---

## ⏳ Time Commitment

- **Weekdays:** ~1–1.5 hours  
- **Weekends:** 4+ hours (deep focus sessions)

Consistency over speed is the priority.

## 📚 Learning Roadmap

### Phase 1: Python Foundations
- Variables, data types, conditions
- Loops and functions
- File handling
- Basic problem-solving

### Phase 2: Data Analysis & Machine Learning
- NumPy, Pandas
- Data preprocessing

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

- Learn slowly, but deeply  
- Avoid copy-paste coding  
- Understand *why* something works  
- Document progress honestly  

Mistakes are part of the process.
